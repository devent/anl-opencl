\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

This quide will describe how to setup a CI/CD with Jenkins on a Kubernetes
cluster. The focus of the quide is to describe how to install the components 
and the plugins needed to compile, test and deliver Java libraries, but
the quide can be expanded to deliver any software via Jenkins. The worker
nodes will be Kubernetes pods that are created on demand.

\subsection{Deploy to Private Repository}

Developers with feature branches can deploy to the private repository.
The code is cloned from the git repository, compiled, tested, the SonarQube
analysis is done and then the artifact is deployed to the private repository.
In addition, the Javadoc site is created and is deployed.

\subsection{Release to Private Repository}

Code that is merged in the ``develop'' branch will be also cloned from the 
git repository, compiled, tested, the SonarQube analysis is run. The artifact
is then released using the Maven release plugin. After the stages are finished
successfully a release artifact is deployed to the private repository.

\subsection{Publish to Public Repository}

Code that is merged in the ``master'' branch will be published to the Maven 
central artifact repository. Since the code was already tested and analyzed by 
SonarQube those steps are skipped to save time.

\subsection{Deploy Site}

This use case is covered automatically by the pipeline in feature branches
and for code that is merged into the ``develop'' branch. It will run the
Maven site plugin to generate the Javadoc and deploy the site to a web
server.
